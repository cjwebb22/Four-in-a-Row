# Four in a Row

### Description:
This is a four-in-a-row command line game. This idea was from an optional assignment for FIT1045 at Monash. Essentially, the assignment was to make a command line four-in-a-row game. The only resemblance to the original assignment this project has is the basic idea of making a four-in-a-row command line game. That's why I am able to put this code on github. I completely redid the code after learning about classes. Then I added a solo game using an AI player that used a minimax algorithm.

### Setup:
You need python > 3.5 to run this script.

### How to run:
You can run this script in the command line using:
```
python3 run_game.py
```
Or, if you only have 1 version of python installed, you can use:
```
python run_game.py
```
