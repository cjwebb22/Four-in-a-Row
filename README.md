# Four in a Row

### Description:
This is a four in a row command line game. This idea was from an optional assignment for FIT1045 at Monash. Essentially, the assignment was to make a command line four in a row game.  I completely redid the code after learning about classes. Then I added a solo game using an AI player that used a minimax algorithm.

### Setup:
You need python > 3.5 to run this script.

### How to run:
You can run this script in the command line using:
```
python3 run_game.py
```
Or, if you only have 1 version of python installed, you can use:
```
python run_game.py
```
