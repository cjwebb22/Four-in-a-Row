# Connect-4

### Description:
This is a Connect 4 command line game. This idea was from the optional assignment for FIT1045 at Monash. All code is my own. Completely redone after learning about classes.

### Setup:
You need python > 3.5 to run this script.

### How to run:
You can run this script in the command line using:
```
python3 run_game.py
```
Or, if you only have 1 version of python installed, you can use:
```
python run_game.py
```
